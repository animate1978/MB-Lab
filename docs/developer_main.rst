Introduction
============

MB-Lab is a complex project that is still only fully understood by Manuel Bastioni himself.
The development of MB-Lab is not only to get x,y,z feature in but to figure out how it works itself. This part of the documentation will focus on how to expand MB-Lab as well as reverse engineer the data and internals.
