MB-Lab was forked from ManuelBastioniLAB in November of 2018, shortly
after Manuel Bastioni ceased development of his addon. As it is open
source, it was placed on GitHub with an invite to others to help develop
and support this amazing tool. What began as a test to see if things
could be changed here or there has turned into a global project with
several sub forks of it's own.

This document is a sub project in itself, it is a WIP and will continue
to be developed over time.
