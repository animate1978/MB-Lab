Installation
============

Install MB-Lab

IMPORTANT

Because of how Github packages releases this WILL affect how you install MB-Lab if downloading from the release page ONLY! If you download a clone where Github renames it MB-Lab-master, you will not have issues. You need to go to that directory and rename it from MB-Lab 1.x.x to MB-Lab-1-x-x or MBLAB170 if you want to be simple, just get rid of the periods in the directory name and Blender will recognize it and add the addon to the list.

Step 1

In Blender, open the user preferences window, choosing File → User Preferences

Step 2

Press the "Install from File" button in the left bottom side of the window

Step 3

Use the file selector window in order to find the zip file, select it and click the button "Install from File".

Step 4

When the installation will be completed, a new category named "Characters" will appear in the Categories list. Select it and enable the lab using the check button. When the plugin is enabled, remember to press the button "Save User Settings", in order to load the lab automatically each time you start Blender.

Step 5

Close the User Preferences window. Press "N" to make the Sidebar with the MB-Lab interface appear in Blender 2.80


Uninstall MB-Lab

In Blender, open the user preferences window, choosing File → User Preferences

In the addons tab, look for Characters → MB-Lab

Click on "Remove" button

It is VERY important to not have multiple copies of ManuelBastioniLAB or MB-Lab, there will be conflicts! Remove the old version first, then install from file the new version.
